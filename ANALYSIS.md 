## Production Analysis

### 1. Context and Problem Statement

Dougs, an accounting firm, must ensure the integrity of bank transactions synchronized by external providers.  
Duplicates and missing transactions are frequent, which can distort clients’ accounting.  
The solution must enable automatic validation of the consistency of bank movements against control points (bank statements) and simplify the accountant’s manual verification.

### 2. Proposed Solution

I developed a REST API using NestJS and TypeScript that validates a list of bank movements against a series of control points (balances).  
The algorithm detects:  
- **Duplicates** (identical movements),  
- **Out-of-period movements** (before the first balance or after the last one),  
- **Balance discrepancies** (sum of movements between two balances not matching the expected difference),  
- **Cases where validation is impossible** (fewer than two balances).  

Validation is performed in a single pass over sorted movements to ensure efficiency and code clarity[1][2].

### 3. API Interface

- **Endpoint**: `POST /movements/validation`  
- **Payload**:  
  - `movements`: list of bank transactions,  
  - `balances`: list of control points.  
- **Response**:  
  - **200 OK**: validation succeeded or failed (result in the body),  
  - **400 Bad Request**: malformed request.  

Validation errors are detailed in the `reasons` field, including the type, message, and necessary details to ease manual review.

### 4. Strengths

- **Robustness**: reliable detection of the most common errors.  
- **Clarity**: explicit error messages with detailed information.  
- **Extensibility**: modular code allowing addition of new rules.  
- **Simplicity**: straightforward interface, easy to consume by other services or UIs.  
- **User Experience**: precise diagnostics to speed up accountants’ work.

### 5. Limitations and Improvement Opportunities

- Fine handling of movements on boundary dates (inclusion/exclusion to be defined).  
- A 0.01 tolerance applied to mitigate floating-point calculation errors.  
- Automated tests should be reinforced to cover edge cases and ensure stability.

### 6. Conclusion

This solution effectively addresses the need for automated validation of bank transactions.  
It facilitates rapid anomaly detection and simplifies manual review, thus ensuring the reliability of accounting data.  
It is ready to be extended for future business requirements or integrations.
